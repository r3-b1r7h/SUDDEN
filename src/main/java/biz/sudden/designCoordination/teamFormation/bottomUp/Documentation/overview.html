The documents within this folder serve to document the Noticeboard system.

The high level design document uses the methodology from MaBE to present a role based
design for the system.

The more detailed design document discusses the more detailed decisions made in the
implementation of the design as an agent based system.

These documents serve to outline the design of the code and the basic principle behind
the systems operation. However if planning substantive changes/updates to the code 
defining the algorithm behind the system please contact:
martin.carpenter@manchester.ac.uk for questions and detailed documentation.
Please do bear in mind that this is of nessecity somewhat technical in nature.

The following papers give useful background and a quick overview of this system:
