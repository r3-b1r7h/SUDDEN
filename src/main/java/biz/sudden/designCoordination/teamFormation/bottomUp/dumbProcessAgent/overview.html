This folder contains an agent suitable for building simple demos like the 
demoManchester0606 and the Watertanl demo.

These agents are essentially a skeleton of what a process agent might look like. They
can fully participate in the required protocols, detect potential extensions and the
like. However they are limited to:

(1) having one & only one declared capability (which is moreover fixed rather than
flexibly defined),

(2) Agreeing to any and all extensions proposed to them.

(3) Always proposing their declared capability when a possiblity presents itself.

All of these represent substantial simplifications over the potential behaviour of
agents within this system.
