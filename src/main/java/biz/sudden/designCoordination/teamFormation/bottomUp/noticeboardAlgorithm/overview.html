This set of classes comprise the algorithm which the noticeboard agent uses to perform extensions.

It's far from the most efficient implementation possible but it seems to work.

An important to bear in mind with these classes is that they ONLY (by design) work when
used in an incremental manner (ie start from a initial and goal state and add in declared
capabilities.). 
There are no facilities for eg creating a partial solution with several
states, declared capabilities etc - and even if you could keeping these keeping the
various parts of the partial solution aligned would be distinctly non trivial.

A further factor which might be initially confusing comes from the control being solely 
within the hands of the process provider agents. This forces considerable design changes 
over a centralised version of this algorithm.
(and the sending of information through ACL messages.).

If planning to change any of the classes within this package please take care - the 
algorithm is (intrisically) non trivial and is not straightforward to work
out what it is doing from the code alone.

In particular if planning a major reimplementation or serious amount of bug fixing
please contact martin.carpenter@manchester.ac.uk for a detailed technical write up of
the algorithm.
