Some 'tests'. 

Currently it's a few agent based tests - these are quite like subparts of the fuller
demos (Manchester0606 & Watertank) which (esp manchester0606) should be taken as the
test that the whole system is running.
There are a lot of multiagent based systems here which could potentially break in 
exciting ways.

To do that kind of test properly you need to understand the algorithm, run the demo
and check that a few of the partial solutions are of the correct form and that it
does (or doesn't if you've switched a few agents off) locate a complete solution in
the end.

Also it is worth noting that these tests as it currently stands have no output -
you have to enable some of the System.out calls in the relevant classes to get the
full benefit from running them.

Some Junit tests for parts of the algorithm are possible and might be produced.
