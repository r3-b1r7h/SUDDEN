It's not Spring friendly yet since I'm just concentrating on getting a very
lightweight framework up. Really just interfaces and some data structures.

Once I've got this up I'll read about Spring in detail and amend appropriately :)

For much of this section I don't expect this to require really big changes - 
very little of this code is user facing.
