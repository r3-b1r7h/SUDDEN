This folder contains the ontologies used within the noticeboard system.

There are no product ontologies here - or anything giving a structure to a potential
product ontology. These ontologies contain the SL constructs used to create and query
about noticeboards and potential extensions etc.

Currently there are no corresponding concrete Java objects, and no plans to create them.

However the algorithm itself is programmed using Java objects internally and hence there is
a need to convert between AbsConcepts & Java objects. The ProcessIntrospector class does 
this (but purposefully not as a normal Jade introspector - the conversions are not 1-1
in terms of the information contained within the Java concepts and the concepts within
the messages.).
