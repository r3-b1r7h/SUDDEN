This folder contains a simple generic SL IRE intepreter.

Writing a 'proper' one would almost certainly best use Prolog or some form of logic programming.
(Since this is how IRE's are defined.).

The interpreter currently works only on IRE's of the form ?x P(x) ^ Q(x) || Q'(x) etc.

Essentially it compiles the predicates in the proposition of the IRE into Java (using predefined rules) to 
produce a single call which will match a given object (of a specific type) vs the IRE to see if it matches
or not.
This then allows execution of the query.

As mentioned above this isn't elegant merely reasonably functional. 

While JADE's variables are themselves typed these IRE interpreters don't strictly check them.

This code is used within the NoticeboardFactory and Noticeboard agents to provide querying
for Noticeboards/Potential Extensions.

NOTE: this is the old single variable IRE interpreter.
See package below (UpdatedIREInterpreter) for a more general one.
