A package for dealing with comparing two constrained types.

Here constrained types are simply AbsConcepts combined with constraint schemata.

NB: the current set of constraints is seriously limited (From an integer range/from a
set of String values.). This will probably have to be later extended.


NB: This code is currently non functional - it was functional in an earlier prototype 
but has been removed for now (while I was rebuilding the main algorithm). It is certainly
not guaranteed to run if used.
